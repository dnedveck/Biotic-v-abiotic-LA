Initial reading of [Hembry *et al*. (2014; *Am Nat*)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677928), which reviews the evidence that coevolutionary selection directly causes the formation of new species. Highlights of discussion:

- Not many good cases are found; 
- Those that are pretty well understood may be too extreme to be generally informative;
- Coevolution may promote diversity within species without promoting speciation;
- Higher within-population diversity may even reduce the relative amount of variation that assorts between populations.

Established [shared Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlDhX4D_L3mvzZgfQYNdb6INZFq39RPimZ1lAL_aR-A/edit?usp=sharing) to coordinate plans for the rest of the semester. Ryan will kick off next week with [Afkhami *et al*. (2014; *Ecol. Lett.*)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12332).

At the end of the semester, we think we have a basis to move forward. A [preliminary literature search](https://docs.google.com/a/umn.edu/spreadsheets/d/1QySxIow48qv6M6ef4s8mCbsuMbh_sZCcZj8aCOiCCb8) for papers containing

- tests for local adaptation
- to at least one biotic interaction AND one abiotic environmental variable
- in a fully factorial design

... has so far yielded 38 papers. We need to establish a more formal plan of action, particularly to conduct a more replication-friendly literature search (establish terms, record results count, then filter), and to determine what specific statistics we will synthesize and how, per [Harrison (2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00056.x), [Koricheva and Gurevitch (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12224), and citations therein. For that purpose, I've asked people to e-mail me requests for inclusion in a new e-mail list, which will organize group meetings starting in the spring semester. E-mail addresses for members are in the file [`contact_list.txt`](./contact_list.txt).
