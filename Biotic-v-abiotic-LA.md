# Project notes

## 2014.09.15

Initial discussion of [Hembry *et al*. (2014; *Am Nat*)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677928), which reviews the evidence that coevolutionary selection directly causes the formation of new species. Not many cases are found; those that are pretty well understood may be too extreme to be generally informative.

Established [shared Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlDhX4D_L3mvzZgfQYNdb6INZFq39RPimZ1lAL_aR-A/edit?usp=sharing) to coordinate plans for the rest of the semester. Ryan will kick off next week with [Afkhami *et al*. (2014; *Ecol. Lett.*)](10.1111/ele.12332).
